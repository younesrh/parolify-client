    lyrics: `Hello, it's me
    I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
    To go over everything
    They say that time's supposed to heal ya
    But I ain't done much healing
    Hello, can you hear me?
    I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
    When we were younger and free
    I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
    There's such a difference between us
    And a million miles
    Hello from the other side
    I must've called a thousand times
    To tell you I'm sorry
    For everything that I've done
    But when I call you never
    Seem to be home
    Hello from the outside
    At least I can say that I've tried
    To tell you I'm sorry
    For breaking your heart
    But it don't matter, it clearly
    Doesn't tear you apart anymore
    Hello, how are you?
    It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
    I hope that you're well
    Did you ever make it out of that town
    Where nothing ever happened?
    It's no secret
    That the both of us
    Are running out of time
    So hello from the other side (other side)
    I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
    To tell you I'm sorry
    For everything that I've done
    But when I call you never
    Seem to be home
    Hello from the outside (outside)
    At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
    To tell you I'm sorry
    For breaking your heart
    But it don't matter, it clearly
    Doesn't tear you apart anymore
    Ooooohh, anymore
    Ooooohh, anymore
    Ooooohh, anymore
    Anymore
    Hello from the other side (other side)
    I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
    To tell you I'm sorry
    For everything that I've done
    But when I call you never
    Seem to be home
    Hello from the outside (outside)
    At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
    To tell you I'm sorry

    lyrics: `You were the shadow to my light
    Did you feel us
    Another start
    You fade away
    Afraid our aim is out of sight
    Wanna see us
    Alive
    Where are you now
    Where are you now
    Where are you now
    Was it all in my fantasy
    Where are you now
    Were you only imaginary
    Where are you now
    Atlantis
    Under the sea
    Under the sea
    Where are you now
    Another dream
    The monsters running wild inside of me
    I'm faded
    I'm faded
    So lost
    I'm faded
    I'm faded
    So lost
    I'm faded
    These shallow waters, never met
    What I needed
    I'm letting go
    A deeper dive
    Eternal silence of the sea
    I'm breathing
    Alive
    Where are you now
    Where are you now
    Under the bright
    But faded lights
    You set my heart on fire
    Where are you now
    Where are you now
    Where are you now
    Atlantis
    Under the sea
    Under the sea
    Where are you now
    Another dream
    The monsters running wild inside of me
    I'm faded
    I'm faded
    So lost
    I'm faded
    I'm faded
    So lost

    I knew him forever in a minute (hey)
    (That summer night in June)
    And papa says he got malo in him (uh)
    He got me feelin' like
    Ooh-ooh-ooh, I knew it when I met him
    I loved him when I left him
    Got me feelin' like
    Ooh-ooh-ooh, and then I had to tell him

    lyrics: `The club isn't the best place to find a lover
    So the bar is where I go
    Me and my friends at the table doing shots
    Drinking fast and then we talk slow
    Come over and start up a conversation with just me
    And trust me I'll give it a chance now
    Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
    And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
    Girl, you know I want your love
    Your love was handmade for somebody like me
    Come on now, follow my lead
    I may be crazy, don't mind me
    Say, boy, let's not talk too much
    Grab on my waist and put that body on me
    Come on now, follow my lead
    Come, come on now, follow my lead
    I'm in love with the shape of you
    We push and pull like a magnet do
    Although my heart is falling too
    I'm in love with your body
    And last night you were in my room
    And now my bedsheets smell like you
    Every day discovering something brand new
    I'm in love with your body
    Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
    I'm in love with your body
    Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
    I'm in love with your body
    Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
    I'm in love with your body
    Every day discovering something brand new
    I'm in love with the shape of you
    One week in we let the story begin
    We're going out on our first date
    You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
    Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
    We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
    And how your family is doing okay
    Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
    Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
    Girl, you know I want your love
    Your love was handmade for somebody like me
    Come on now, follow my lead
    I may be crazy, don't mind me
    Say, boy, let's not talk too much

    lyrics: `Feeling used but I'm still missing you
    And I can't see the end of this
    Just wanna feel your kiss
    Against my lips
    And now all this time is passing by
    But I still can't seem to tell you why
    It hurts me every time I see you
    Realize how much I need you
    I hate you, I love you
    I hate that I love you
    Don't want to but I can't put
    Nobody else above you
    I hate you, I love you
    I hate that I want you
    You want her, you need her
    And I'll never be her
    I miss you when I can't sleep
    Or right after coffee
    Or right when I can't eat
    I miss you in my front seat
    Still got sand in my sweaters
    From nights we don't remember
    Do you miss me like I miss you?
    Fucked around and got attached to you
    Friends can break your heart too
    And I'm always tired but never of you
    If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
    I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
    I type a text but then I never mind that shit
    I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
    Oh, oh, keep it on the low
    You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
    If you wanted me you would just say so
    And if I were you, I would never let me go
    I hate you, I love you
    I hate that I love you
    Don't want to but I can't put
    Nobody else above you
    I hate you, I love you
    I hate that I want you
    You want her, you need her
    And I'll never be her
    I don't mean no harm
    I just miss you on my arm
    Wedding bells were just alarms
    Caution tape around my heart
    You ever wonder what we could have been?
    You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
    Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
    Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
    Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
    Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
    I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
    But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
    When love and trust are gone
    I guess this is moving on
    Everyone I do right does me wrong
    So every lonely night I sing this song
    I hate you, I love you
    I hate that I love you
    Don't want to but I can't put
    Nobody else above you
    I hate you, I love you
    I hate that I want you
    You want her, you need her
    And I'll never be her
    All alone I watch you watch her
    Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
    You don't care, you never did
    You don't give a damn about me
    Yeah, all alone I watch you watch her
    She is the only thing you ever see
    How is it you never notice
    That you are slowly killing me
    I hate you, I love you
    I hate that I love you
    Don't want to but I can't put
    Nobody else above you
    I hate you, I love you
    I hate that I want you
    You want her, you need her
    And I'll never be her`,

    Taking my sulking to the masses
    Writing my poems for the few

    Taking my message from the veins
    Speaking my lesson from the brain
    Seeing the beauty through the...

    Send a prayer to the ones up above
    All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
    Your spirit up above, oh ooh
    
    I was choking in the crowd
    Building my rain up in the cloud
    Falling like ashes to the ground
    Hoping my feelings, they would drown
    But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
    Inhibited, limited
    Till it broke open and rained down
    And rained down, like...
    
    Pain!
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
    
    Last things last
    By the grace of the fire and the flames
    You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
    The blood in my veins, oh ooh
    But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
    Inhibited, limited
    Till it broke open and rained down
    And rained down, like...
    
    Pain!
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
    Pain!
    You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer

    lyrics: `When you get older, plainer, saner
    When you remember all the danger we came from
    Burning like embers, falling, tender
    Long before the days of no surrender
    Years ago and well you know
    Smoke 'em if you got 'em
    'Cause it's going down
    All I ever wanted was you
    I'll never get to heaven
    'Cause I don't know how
    Let's raise a glass or two
    To all the things I've lost on you
    Oh oh
    Tell me are they lost on you?
    Oh oh
    Just that you could cut me loose
    Oh oh
    After everything I've lost on you
    Is that lost on you?
    Oh oh
    Is that lost on you?
    Oh oh
    Baby, is that lost on you?
    Is that lost on you?
    Wishing I could see the machinations
    Understand the toil of expectations in your mind
    Hold me like you never lost your patience
    Tell me that you love me more than hate me all the time
    And you're still mine
    So smoke 'em if you've got 'em
    'Cause it's going down
    All I ever wanted was you
    Let's take a drink of heaven
    This can turn around
    Let's raise a glass or two
    To all the things I've lost on you
    Oh oh
    Tell me are they lost on you?
    Oh oh
    Just that you could cut me loose
    Oh oh
    After everything I've lost on you
    Is that lost on you?
    Oh oh
    Is that lost on you?
    Oh oh, oh oh
    Bab, is that lost on you?
    Is that lost on you?
    Let's raise a glass or two
    To all the things I've lost on you
    Oh oh
    Tell me are they lost on you?
    Oh oh
    Just that you cold cut me loose
    Oh oh
    After everything I've lost on you
    Is that lost on you?
    Is that lost on you?`,

    lyrics: `I won't lie to you
    I know he's just not right for you
    And you can tell me if I'm off
    But I see it on your face
    When you say that he's the one that you want
    And you're spending all your time
    In this wrong situation
    And anytime you want it to stop
    I know I can treat you better
    Than he can
    And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
    Tell me why are we wasting time
    On all your wasted cryin'
    When you should be with me instead
    I know I can treat you better
    Better than he can
    I'll stop time for you
    The second you say you'd like me to
    I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
    Baby, just to wake up with you
    Would be everything I need and this could be so different
    Tell me what you want to do
    'Cause I know I can treat you better
    Than he can
    And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
    Tell me why are we wasting time
    On all your wasted cryin'
    When you should be with me instead
    I know I can treat you better
    Better than he can
    Better than he can
    Give me a sign
    Take my hand, we'll be fine
    Promise I won't let you down
    Just know that you don't
    Have to do this alone
    Promise I'll never let you down
    'Cause I know I can treat you better
    Than he can
    And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
    Tell me why are we wasting time
    On all your wasted cryin'
    When you should be with me instead
    I know I can treat you better
    Better than he can, oh oh
    Better than he can
    Better than he can`,
